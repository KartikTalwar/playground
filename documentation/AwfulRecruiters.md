Hello,

Thank you for your note. I am not interested for the following reason(s):

- You do not include the specific name of the company you represent, which
   - leads me to believe you are just canvassing and
   - limits my ability to filter based on companies I don’t care for

- You do not call out the specific skills I have that make me a “perfect fit”

- You refer to skills or interests a) substantially in my past and/or b) clearly not part of my current role
 or expertise

- If your CEO/CTO/VP Eng/Director thought my background sounded good, he/she should have emailed me personally

- I will not send you any leads because I am already personally recruiting all the good people I know

- Your request that we start with a “quick call” shows a clear disregard for the [work style of engineers](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html)

- You appear to have misspelled my name despite having my email address to use as starting point
